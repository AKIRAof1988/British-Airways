# Project Overview:
This repository contains code and findings from a data science project aimed at predicting customer holiday bookings using machine learning techniques. The project involves exploring, preparing, training a predictive model, evaluating its performance, and summarizing findings in a PowerPoint presentation.

# Files and Directories:
Getting Started Notebook: Jupyter Notebook for initial data exploration and basic dataset statistics.
Python Scripts: Python files for data preparation, model training, and evaluation.
PowerPoint Template: Template for the summary presentation.
Resources Directory: Contains useful links and resources used throughout the project.

# Project Steps:
Explore Dataset: Understand the dataset columns and statistics using the provided Jupyter Notebook.
Data Preparation: Processed data for modeling, created new features to enhance predictive power.
Model Training: Used RandomForest algorithm to predict customer bookings and analyzed variable contributions.
Model Evaluation: Conducted cross-validation, evaluated model performance, and visualized variable contributions.
Summary Presentation: Compiled findings and insights in a PowerPoint slide using the provided template.

# How to Use:
Getting Started: Follow the steps outlined in the Jupyter Notebook to understand the dataset and initial exploration.
Data Preparation: Run the Python scripts to preprocess data and create new features as necessary.
Model Training: Execute the model training script to build and analyze the RandomForest model.
Model Evaluation: Run the evaluation script to conduct cross-validation and visualize variable contributions.
Summary Presentation: Customize the PowerPoint template with your findings and conclusions.
